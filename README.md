====

An implementation of Legendre Decomposition in Python.

## Description

An implementation of the Legendre Decomposition[[1]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8097-legendre-decomposition-for-tensors) in Python(>=3.6), which is non-negative tensor decomposition method using information geometric formulation of the log-linear model which we can solve as a convex optimization problem.

This is not an official implementation and the author's implementation in C++ is available here [[2]](https://github.com/mahito-sugiyama/Legendre-decomposition).

## Usage
```python
import numpy as np
from ld import LegendreDecomposition

# generate third-order tensor.
P = np.random.rand(8, 5, 3)

# create an instance of Legendre Decomposition.
ld = LegendreDecomposition(solver='ng', max_iter=5)

# compute and get reconstructed tensors using scikit-learn like API.
reconst_tensor = ld.fit_transform(P)
```

`LegendreDecomposition` offers some options including the following:

- `solver`: Type of solver:
  - `'ng'`: natural gradient method.
  - `'gd'`: gradient descent method.
- `max_iter`: The number of iterations of the solver.
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for gradient descent method.

As of now, it doesn't support order of input tensor more than 4, means it supports second or third order.
